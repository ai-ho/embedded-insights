Summary of the topics are already available for Board Support Packages:
| Topic    | Description |
| :-------- | :------- |
| [Tiva C BSP Example](/Board_Support_Packages/tivac-bsp-example/)  | An example of Board Support Packages implementation for Tiva C Launchpad Board |

# Requisitions
The below requistions are used for demostration only. For your case, you can choose another setup and implement the idea provided in the examples.
## Hardware
Development Kit used in the most of topics is [Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit - EK-TM4C123GXL](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL). The main microcontroller on the development kit is ARM Cortex-M4F 32-bit produced by Texas Instruments. Moreover, there is on-board Debugger/Programmer (Stellaris ICDI) that enable user quickly flashes and debugs easily.

Additionally, during testing and debugging, I also use Logic Analyzer to measure and capture the signal of microcontroller input/output pins.

## Software
[Keil C](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm) is an IDE developed by ARM company. It is a very powerful tool supports software engineer to compose, edit, compile, flash code and debug. Especially, with non-comercial version, I think it fully supports all your needs to study and research.

To visualize the measured signals of microcontroller pins from Logic Analyzer and easy to analyze the logs, [Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/pages/downloads) tool is one of the suitable choices.
