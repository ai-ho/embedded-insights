# Non-blocking Implementation For Time-Delay
In this topic I will talk about one of the solutions to implement the tradition time-dely function in the different way. The expectation is to remove the blocking waits in-line, efficiently utilize the CPU resource, and make the software is more responsive.

# Problem With Traditional Time-Delay Function
When I looking back to the example [Board Support Package Example](https://github.com/Sigma-eLabs/embedded-software-programming-concepts/tree/main/Board_Support_Packages), where I demonstrate one implementation of Board Support Package for Tiva C Launch Pad, there are few things I'm not happy with:
* The first thing is the delay function. I used delay function to make the software wait for a while. After the waiting time is overed, the software continue to process the next instructions. The problem is the software do the for/while loop to increase/decrease a counter until the counter is reach the threshold (synchronous), but do nothing else. You can figure out that it's a wasteness, right? Maybe you can think that instead of sitting and waiting, the software use this time to process another job, then comeback and check the time later (asynchronous).

  </a>
</p>

* The second thing is I used the SW1 button state (pressed or released) to check whether the LED blinky should be peformed in the main() function. However, I think that it's may caused the misunderstanding for you because in reality the state pressed of SW1 button is changed quickly for a momment and not keep for a long time. So, I thing there is a chance to improve the implementation to make the software is more robustness.

# Solution
* To resolve the problem with tradition delay function, I need the support of the "watch". In ARM-CortexM, we have System Tick Timer, which is suitable to support this case. I will use one counter to tracking the time-stamp when the software running to check if the delay time is elapsed. Beside of that, I need the state of blinky job to decide which actions should be done like turn LED on/off, check if the desired time-delay is elapsed, initialize/reset the job.

* For the secode problem, instead of using the state of SW1 button, I use the state of the blinky job, which is "requested" in case the button is pressed and "finished" when the blinky job is finished or initialized.

# Implementation
I place the source code of this example here: :rocket: [Non-blocking delay Example](/Non_Blocking_Delay/Non_Blocking_Delay_Sample/non-blocking-delay-sample/) :rocket:

* Implemation of SysTick_Handler() function, which will update the tick counter every system tick is eslapsed.
  ```C
  void SysTick_Handler(void) {
    ++l_tickCounter;
  }
  ```

* Enable the use of System Tick:
  ```C
	/* interrupt set up for System Tick */
	SystemCoreClockUpdate();
  SysTick_Config(SystemCoreClock / BSP_TICKS_PER_SEC); /* by this setting, the Sytem Tick will occured 100 (100Hz) times every second */
  NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, 0U); /* set the SysTick interrupt priority (highest) */
  ```
* To get the current time-stamp of the software, I use this function:
  ```C
  uint32_t BSP_getTickCounter(void) {
    uint32_t tickCounter;
    
    /* enter critical context here is to prevent
    interrupt occurs and modifies the value of l_tickCounter */
    __disable_irq();
    tickCounter = l_tickCounter;
    __enable_irq();
    
    return tickCounter;
  }
  ```
* LED blinky state is defined with 4 state here:
  ```C
  typedef enum {
    BLINKY_INITIAL,
    BLINKY_OFF,
    BLINKY_ON,
    BLINKY_STOP
  } BlinkyState;
  ```

* To check if the delay time of LED on/off state is overed, I use the combination of LED blinky state and logic to check:
  ```C
  case BLINKY_ON: {
    if ((BSP_getTickCounter() - start) > (BSP_TICKS_PER_SEC / 2U)) {
      BSP_setRedledState(LED_OFF);
      blinkyState = BLINKY_OFF;
      start = BSP_getTickCounter();
    }
    break;
  }
  ```

* The blinky job is known as Requested if the SW1 button is pressed, and reset back to Finished once the job is done.
  ```C
  /* interrupt function is invoked when GPIOF interrupt happened */
  void GPIOPortF_IRQHandler(void) {
    if ((GPIOF_AHB->RIS & USR_SW1) != 0U) { /* check if the interrupt caused by User button switch 1 - PF4 pin pressed */
      blinkyJobStat = JOB_REQUESTED;	/* blinky job requested */
    }
    
    GPIOF_AHB->ICR = USR_SW1;	/* clear the interrupt source caused by User button switch 1, otherwise it is remained forever */
  }
  ```
  ```C
  case BLINKY_STOP: {
      /* reset the state of UsrSw1 button */
      blinkyJobStat = JOB_FINISHED;	/* job is done */
      blinkyState = BLINKY_INITIAL;	/* reset the blinky state */
    break;
  }
  ```
* Now, the tradition BSP_delay() function is not needed anymore and the software can use the CPU resource to do another useful thing. Also, the software implementation is more readable than before.

* To implement this software, you should read [Tiva‚Ñ¢ TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller Datasheet](https://github.com/Sigma-eLabs/technical-resources/blob/main/tiva-c-series/tm4c123gh6pm.pdf), the chapters related to GPIO, System Control modules to know about the functionality of common registers. Especially, the you should read about the interrupt related registers.

* You also should read [Tiva‚Ñ¢ C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Board User's Guide](https://github.com/Sigma-eLabs/technical-resources/blob/main/tiva-c-series/spmu296.pdf) to know about the hardware design of the development kit which is being used.

* Additionally, you understand and know how to use the provided standard libraries like [Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS)](https://github.com/Sigma-eLabs/technical-resources/tree/main/tiva-c-series/CMSIS), [Tiva‚Ñ¢ TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller Software Support Package](https://github.com/Sigma-eLabs/technical-resources/tree/main/tiva-c-series/ek-tm4c123gxl), which support Arm-Cortex architecture processor and TM4C123GHPM controller.

# Deployment & Verification
The software is flashed inton Tiva C Launch Pad. I reset the software, pressed the SW1 button and recorded the result by Logic Analyzer:

# Drawbacks
* Even though I have demonstrated one solution to elimate the blocking wait in-line and help the software can utilize the CPU to process another job to make it's more responsive. However, I need to enable System Tick, use more state variables to hold the information and the comlexity of logic is increased. Which means, I have to design and implement the software more carefully.

* Nothing is perfect and the software is also the same. I see that there are many chances to improve. Can you try it?
